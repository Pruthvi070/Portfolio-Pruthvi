    title: "Food Delivery App",
    description:
      "This project begins with the development of the Home page, where users can view a menu and browse various food items. You will then create a Cart page and an Order page to facilitate the ordering process. Additionally, a Sign In/Sign Up popup will be implemented to enable user authentication. The app will be built using React.js, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and will integrate the Stripe payment gateway for secure online payments. User authentication will allow anyone to create an account and log in, while shopping cart functionality will enable users to add food items and place orders seamlessly. Furthermore, order status update features will enhance the user experience by keeping customers informed about their order progress.",
